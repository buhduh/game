I messed git up....
master branch compiles and is mostly in the state it was before i merged feature/dale/basicshadingV2 and deleted said branch
feature/dale/memoryattemp2 was branched after the merge and is the newer commit
I forced master to rewind a few commits so it would at least build and run as expected.

DO NOT make new branches until you can get feature/dale/memoryattempt2 or some derivative branch functioning as master
