tried to do a bunch of failed memory crap here.... feature/dale/basicshading
fuck all that, need to implement faces i think? feature/dale/basicshadingV2

1. Think I got it all working again..., write the binary file again
2. Might goof around with memory a bit.
3. Don't think LDFLAGS are quite correct in the memory project.
